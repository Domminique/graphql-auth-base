# Deep learning for computer vision with python and TensorFlow by Machine learning Engineer Dominc Imbuga Ahutu

As machine learning finds increasing use in virtually every industry, there’s a growing need for people to bring machine learning models into production

## Production cycle
To understand different roles involving machine learning in production, let’s first explore different steps in a production cycle. There are six major steps in a production cycle.
Project scoping

A project starts with scoping the project, laying out goals & objectives, constraints, and evaluation criteria. Stakeholders should be identified and involved. Resources should be estimated and allocated.

Main skills needed: product management, subject matter expertise to understand problems, some ML knowledge to know what ML can and can’t solve.

###Data management

Data used and generated by ML systems can be large and diverse, which requires scalable infrastructure to process and access it fast and reliably. Data management covers data sources, data formats, data processing, data control, data storage, etc.

Main skills needed: databases/query engines to know how to store/retrieve/process data, systems engineering to implement distributed systems to process large amounts of data, minimal ML knowledge to optimize the organization data for ML access patterns would be helpful, but not required.

###ML model development

From raw data, you need to create training datasets and possibly label them, then generate features, train models, optimize models, and evaluate them. This is the stage that requires the most ML knowledge and is most often covered in ML courses.

Main skills needed: This is the part of the process that requires the most amount of ML knowledge, statistics and probability to understand the data and evaluate models. Since feature engineering and model development require writing code, this part needs coding skills, especially in algorithms and data structures.

###Deployment

After a model is developed, it needs to be made accessible to users.

Main skills needed: Bringing an ML model to users is largely an infrastructure problem: how to set up your infrastructures or help your customers set up their infrastructures to run your ML application. These applications are often data-, memory-, and compute-intensive. It might also require ML to compress ML models and optimize inference latency unless you can push these to the previous step of the process.

###Monitoring and maintenance

Once in production, models need to be monitored for performance decay and maintained/updated to be adaptive to changing environments and changing requirements.

Main skills needed: Monitoring and maintenance is also an infrastructure problem that requires computer systems knowledge. Monitoring often requires generating and tracking a large amount of system-generated data (e.g. logs), and managing this data requires an understanding of the data pipeline.

###Business analysis

Model performance needs to be evaluated against business goals and analyzed to generate business insights. These insights can then be used to eliminate unproductive projects or scope out new projects.

Main skills needed: This part of the process requires ML knowledge to interpret ML model’s outputs and behavior, in-depth statistics and probability knowledge to extract insights from data, as well as subject matter expertise to map these insights to the practical problems the ML models are supposed to solve.

"Atlas Search index" is a data structure that categorizes data in an easily searchable format. It is a mapping between terms and the documents that contain those terms. Atlas Search indexes enable faster retrieval of documents using certain identifiers. 

You can create an Atlas Search index on a single field or on multiple fields. We recommend that you index the fields that you regularly use to sort or filter your data in order to quickly retrieve the documents that contain the relevant data at query-time.

mongodb+srv://dominic:ug2EvjJsgsh6zAtF@cluster0.jjzsk.mongodb.net/mongostore?retryWrites=true&w=majority

 Create a database named “mongostore” with 2 collections “products” and “customers” with the .json files in the git repository.

    {
        "$search":{
            "text":{
                "query": "mongostore",
                "path":""
            }
        }
    }
]);

Create Search Index named “default” on products collection
